  /*This implementation uses inheritance to represent the relationships between the different classes. The Animal class is the base class, and the other classes inherit from it to add additional characteristics. The Backbone and WithoutBackbone classes represent the presence or absence of a backbone in the animals, and the ColdBlooded and WarmBlooded classes represent the blood temperature of the animals. The other classes represent specific groups of animals, such as fish, reptiles, and mammals.*/
